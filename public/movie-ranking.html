<h1>The Movies Worthwatching! </h1>
<h2>My Top Choices</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Scoop</h3>
<p>Well yes. To see Gillian Anderson play Emily is worth the whole thing. 
I must confess that Gillian Anderson wasn't an actress I cared about or thought in anyway as a contender among her contemporaries.
Her character in the X Files was what settled in my brain, so, nothing earth shattering until, well until her Margaret Thatcher in The Crown. 
That took me completely by surprise and blew me away. Now "Scoop" and she's the main reason to take your breath away.
It's not an impersonation but something else. Something that belongs to great acting. Rufus Sewell was very good in the impossible task of playing Prince Andrew but Gillian Anderson bridges that impossibility and makes that, already famous interview, totally and utterly riveting.
So, well done and thank you.</p>

<h3>RRR ***</h3>
<p>The cinematography and the music is awesome.<br />
It won the Oscars for - The Best non-english song Category.<br />
This was an incredible film. I never heard of this film until Netflix brought it up. 
I saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it.
I am glad I did, the dancing scene at the party was incredible. Arguably the scene was the best scene in the film. 
But also the first scene where Ram Charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well. Overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action, comedy, romance, dancing and great storytelling.

<h3>The Equalizer 3</h3>
<p>The Equalizer 3 rounds out this unexpected trilogy with another satisfying action thriller that continues the journey of a man who understands violence, 
trying to finally put that behind him, placing him out of his element to show quite literally how far he goes for people. 
The ending hinders it a little because it feels anticlimactic but it still works.</p>

<p>On a quest to finally find and maintain happiness, Denzel Washington is as flawless as ever. 
This time around he gets to be happy and show McCall actually enjoying life for once and as this is the final instalment there's obviously some introspection and self reflection as well.</p>
